# Token M Android client integration boundary

The client calls only the current official username/password methods: `createCaptcha({ scene })`, `refreshCaptcha({ scene })`, `registerUser({ username, password, captcha })`, `login({ username, password, captcha? })`, `logout()`, `closeAccount()`, and `setPushCid({ pushClientId })`. Registration uses scene `register`; login uses scene `login` only for its optional/risk-triggered captcha. The repository includes the unmodified official `uni-id-pages-x` 1.2.4 module and its declared dependency closure from DCloud's formal `master` branch so HBuilderX can generate the `uni-id-co` client type. Its local schemas and `uni-config-center` defaults are source inputs only; they have not been uploaded or initialized in `tokenm-prod`.

Push initialization is fail-closed. Neither `onPushMessage` nor `getPushClientId` is called until the official local session is current, the server reports the current Token M consent version accepted, and the user has explicitly tapped the notification CTA at least once. The listener is a module-level singleton and is removed with the same callback on logout. The CID is sent only to `uniIdCo.setPushCid`; the Token M business device call contains only enabled state, label, permission state, and push-registration state. `tokenm-co` adds platform, app version, and device identity from trusted `clientInfo` and rejects a CID in its input.

`AndroidManifest.xml` disables framework-level automatic notification permission requests. The notification CTA requests `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` through the HBuilderX 5.24 `UTSAndroid.requestSystemPermission` API before the single-argument `uni.onPushMessage(callback)` registration. Its package keeps Android's built-in `${applicationId}` placeholder. The frozen compiler is HBuilderX 5.24.2026081301. Verify Android 12 and Android 13+ permission flows, deny/don't-ask-again recovery, one listener across foreground/background cycles, CID refresh, cold-start notification clicks, malformed payload fallback, session expiry, consent-version rollover, logout device disablement, and account-close logout failure. No real push was initialized or sent during this phase.
