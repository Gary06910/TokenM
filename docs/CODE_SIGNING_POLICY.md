# Token M Code Signing Policy

Status: planned / intended. Token M has not been approved by SignPath Foundation, and this repository does not claim that a Token M 1.0.0 binary is currently signed.

The intended service disclosure is included because the SignPath Foundation open-source conditions require it on the project home page and download/release pages:

> Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/), certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The sentence above describes the intended application and is not evidence that the application has been accepted or that a signing request has completed.

## Scope

- The official Token M 1.0.0 Desktop binary distribution is Windows x64 only.
- macOS and Linux source/build support remains in the repository, but no official macOS or Linux binary is distributed in 1.0.0.
- Android is a separate Token M mobile client and is not built by the Desktop GitHub Release workflow.

## Intended signing controls

After Token M receives its own SignPath project and is approved for the intended service, the release workflow will:

1. build the unpacked Windows application from this repository on a GitHub-hosted runner;
2. submit only the unpacked `application/Token M.exe` input for application signing;
3. verify the returned Authenticode signature and timestamp before packaging;
4. build the NSIS installer and portable executable from those signed application bytes;
5. submit the installer and portable executable as separate exact paths for release signing;
6. regenerate `latest.yml` and the installer blockmap after the signed bytes are returned;
7. verify the publisher, Authenticode status, and timestamp for every public Windows executable; and
8. stage only the final verified Windows files for the GitHub Release.

Missing Token M SignPath configuration fails the workflow before any signing request. The workflow has no fallback to the upstream SignPath organization, project, policy, or artifact configuration.

## Token M project configuration

The actual organization ID, project slug, signing-policy slug, artifact-configuration slugs, and API token are intentionally not stored in this repository. The workflow requires these repository settings:

- Secret: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_API_TOKEN`
- Variable: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_ORGANIZATION_ID`
- Variable: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_PROJECT_SLUG`
- Variable: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_SIGNING_POLICY_SLUG`
- Variable: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_APPLICATION_ARTIFACT_CONFIGURATION_SLUG`
- Variable: `TOKEN_M_SIGNPATH_RELEASE_ARTIFACT_CONFIGURATION_SLUG`

The Token M SignPath project must create these two logical artifact configurations. Their actual SignPath slugs are supplied through the variables above rather than invented in source control:

### Token M Windows Application

The configuration signs exactly `application/Token M.exe` and enforces product name `Token M` and the submitted version. The version-controlled definition is `.github/signpath/application-artifact-configuration.xml`.

### Token M Windows Release Artifacts

The configuration signs exactly:

- `installer/Token-Monitor-Setup-${version}.exe`
- `portable/Token-Monitor-${version}.exe`

It enforces product name `Token M` and the submitted version for both PE files. The version-controlled definition is `.github/signpath/artifact-configuration.xml`.

The SignPath project should use GitHub as a trusted build system, enable origin verification for the release policy, restrict the policy to the Token M release branch pattern, and require manual approval for every production signing request.

## Team roles and account controls

- Authors / maintainers: [@Gary06910](https://github.com/Gary06910), the current Token M repository owner and maintainer.
- Reviewers: [@Gary06910](https://github.com/Gary06910) reviews changes proposed by non-committers; any future delegated reviewer must be recorded in this policy before use.
- Approvers: [@Gary06910](https://github.com/Gary06910) is the intended manual release-signing approver; a successful CI submission is not approval.

Everyone with GitHub or SignPath access used for this project must enable multi-factor authentication before the Foundation application and must review workflow files, build scripts, and makefiles as part of source review.

## Privacy and user controls

Token M is not a pure offline application. Usage logs and local usage statistics are processed on the device. GitHub is used for update checks. When the user explicitly enables and pairs Token M notifications, the Desktop sends the allowlisted completion event to the user-configured Token M backend / uniCloud for delivery to Android. The current Android system notification uses generic completion text and task identity; prompt text, reply text, absolute `cwd`, terminal output, source code, and file contents are not included in that system notification. See the [Token M privacy policy](privacy.md).

The Windows installer provides an uninstaller. Removing the application does not silently delete `%APPDATA%\Token Monitor`, which contains user settings, credentials, usage history, pairing data, and notification outbox data; users may remove that data separately when they intend to do so.

## Download verification

For an approved signed release, Windows Explorer should report a valid Digital Signature from SignPath Foundation for `Token-Monitor-Setup-<version>.exe`, `Token-Monitor-<version>.exe`, and the installed `Token M.exe`. PowerShell can be used to inspect the status and timestamp:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature ".\Token-Monitor-Setup-<version>.exe", ".\Token-Monitor-<version>.exe" |
  Format-List Path, Status, SignerCertificate, TimeStamperCertificate
```
